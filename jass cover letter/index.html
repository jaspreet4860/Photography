		Dear Mr.Jhon Smith,<br> 
		I’m writing to you regarding [COMPANY NAME]’s Web Developer opening, which I discovered on Indeed. I’ve been working as a Web Developer at Grooming <br>Technologies for more than 9 years now, and during that time I’ve revamped web security applications,designed and developed a user-friendly website, and trained <br>over 50 staff members in internal web functions. I’m interested in working for [COMPANY NAME] because I want to further my own knowledge and interest in<br> web development, and I believe I’ll be able to offer new ideas to help [COMPANY NAME] reach and surpass the primary objectives mentioned in its job ad.<br>

My core duties at Grooming Technologies included designing user interfaces, testing and debugging websites, and training staff. Additionally, my work revamping our <br>security applications diminished hacker attacks from 2.3% to 0.02%. I also redesigned our website—increasing visitor clicks by 37% and customer purchases by <br>20%. Prior to this position, I worked at Focus Solutions as a Web Developer where I assisted in developing a user-friendly website that increased sales revenue by 40%.<br>

This professional experience has helped me improve my skills in leadership, allowed me to gain mastery over necessary development tools, and provided me with <br>extensive knowledge of how to design a user friendly, secure website. I believe my skill set will benefit [COMPANY NAME], which has the clear potential to increase <br>online revenue and expand its audience.

I’m looking forward to discussing the position and my qualifications with you in more detail soon. I feel confident that I fulfill <br>the requirements for the Web Developer position. You can contact me at (123) 456-7890, or by email at abcwebtech@gmail.com. If I have not heard from you in a week,<br> I will reach out to you again. Thank you for your time and consideration.<br>





Sincerely,<br>



Name<br>
Jaspreet Kaur,
